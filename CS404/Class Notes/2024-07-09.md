# Consequentialism
For #Consequentialism, right actions are those actions that bring about the greatest overall good.

For #Utilitarianism, utility is defined in terms of individual well-being and happiness
- Started by Bentham, mid 1800s

# Higher Pleasures
- Creativity
- Developing a skill
- Pursuing knowledge or expertise
- Cultivating deep friendship
- Creating strong family ties
- Etc.

# Impartiality
The happiness which forms the utilitarian standard of what is right in conduct, is not the agent's own happiness, but that of all concerned. As between his own happiness and that of others, utilitarianism requires him to be as strictly impartial as a disinterested and benevolent spectator


# Act Utilitarianism
## Defining Factors
- Scope
	- How many people are impacted
- Duration
	- How long does the impact last
- Intensity
	- How serious the pain, how good the pleasure
	- An act that causes the death of a human being is of greater magnitude of consequences than act that causes a person to suffer a minor injury
- Probability
	- How probable is this harm to occur.

# Deontological Asymmetry
Doing harm is typically worse than allowing harm
