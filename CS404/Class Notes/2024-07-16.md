#ChineseRoom
- Say you have somebody who doesn't know Chinese
- you put them in a room with a manual with English characters that tell you how to respond with Chinese characters
- Even if he is in there for years, he still doesn't know the meaning of any Chinese at all


#Compatibilism
- Compatibilists believe that determinism, if true, poses no threat whatsoever to free will
- Our actions are determined, sure, but by our own preferences, personalities, and experiences.
- Deterministic processes do not bypass one's desires and deliberations
	- Rather, they ensure that such mental states are the cause of one's actions rather than mere chance
- Our choices are importantly dependent on our knowledge and preferences, and thus controlled by them

#Epiphenomenalism
- the claim that our conscious mental states are only effects of unconscious mental processes, not causes of our actions.
