# Common Morality
#CommonMorality is the moral system that people use, usually not consciously, in deciding how to act when confronting moral problems and in making their moral judgements
- Although most moral decisions are not made by explicitly employing any account of morality, we hope to provide a framework of common morality that will accomplish three tasks
	- Make clear that there is agreement on the overwhelming majority of cases
	- Make clear the sources of moral disagreement and explain why there may sometimes be no unique best solution
	- Make clear that new and perplexing problems can be described in a way that shows their similarity to more familiar moral matters.

He argues that it is impossible to give a description of morality that will both
- Resolve every moral disagreement
- Be endorsed by all rational persons

Most moral theories seek to improve on or present a simple account of common morality

Morality is primarily a guide for action, not an account of what counts as the best state of affairs\
- The danger in viewing morality as being concerned with the best state of affairs is that what is regarded as the best state of affairs can sometimes be brought about only in a morally unacceptable way.

_Morality is an informal public system applying to all rational persons, governing behavior that affects others, and includes what are commonly known as the moral rules, ideals and virtues and has the lessening of evil or harm as its goal_.

A public system has the following characteristics
- All persons to whom it applies understand it
- It is not irrational for any of these persons to accept being guided and judged by that system

In order for all rational persons to know what morality requires, prohibits, allows, and encourages, knowledge of the moral system cannot involve any beliefs that are not held by all rational persons
- No facts from modern science
- No facts from religious beliefs
- Only those beliefs which it would be irrational for any moral agent not to hold
	- These are known as Required Beliefs

Rationally required beliefs include generate factual beliefs such as: people are vulnerable, they can be harmed by other people; and people are fallible, they have limited knowledge.
- Having these beliefs is necessary in order to be a moral agent

Although all those who are held responsible for their actions know what morality requires, etc. morality is not a simple system.
- Almost no competent speaker can explicitly describe the system of grammatical systems, yet they all know it in the sense that they make use of it when speaking and in interpreting the speech of others

Morality is an informal public system, a public system that has no authoritative judges or procedures for determining a unique correct answer.
- Presupposes overwhelming agreement on most matters that are likely to arise\
- Has no established procedures or authorities that can resolve every moral disagreement

Abortion is an unresolvable moral question because it involves the scope of morality, that is, it concerns who is impartially protected by the moral rules
- Everyone in the issue recognizes that there can be rational impartial persons on the other side who disagree

Unresolvable differences
- Who is protected (besides moral agents)
- Differences in the rankings of harms and benefits
- Differences in estimates of the harmful and beneficial consequences of everyone knowing that a given kind of violation is allowed
- Differences about whether the action is of a kind that would be immoral unless justified

# The Moral Rules
#MoralRule - a rule whose violation is immoral unless one has an adequate justification

He prefers to put the rules into being ten rules, however one could formulate the rules to only be two:
- Do not cause harm
- Do not violate the norms necessary for society

Gert's ten moral rules
1. Do not kill
2. Do not cause pain
3. Do not disable
4. Do not deprive of freedom
5. Do not deprive of pleasure
6. Do not deceive
7. Keep your promises
8. Do not cheat
9. Obey the law
10. Do your duty

These rules are not absolute; they all have justified exceptions, and most moral problems involve determining which exceptions are justified
- People disagree about what counts as an adequate moral justification for some particular violation of a rule, e.g., deceiving or breaking the law
- Everyone agrees that what counts as an adequate justification for one person must be an adequate justification for anyone else in the same situation

#MoralAttitude
- _Everyone is always to obey a moral rule except when a fully informed rational person can publicly allow violating it. If all fully informed rational persons publicly allow the violation, it is strongly justified. If fully informed rational person disagree about whether to publicly allow the violation, it is weakly justified_.

When deciding whether or not an impartial rational person can advocate that a violation of a moral rule be publicly allowed, the following should be considered
1. What moral rules would be violated?
2. Are there any alternative actions that would be preferable?
3. Is the violation being done intentionally or only knowingly?

#MoralIdeals - Encourage people to prevent, lessen, or relieve the harms that moral rules prevent us from causing--death, pain, loss of pleasure, freedom or ability
# Consideration of a Particular Case
In order to justify illegally copying software, one has to hold either that the law is clearly an unjust one, or that it is morally justifiable to break morally acceptable laws with which one disagrees for the benefit of oneself or one's friends.

To publicly allow a violation of a rule is to propose that this kind of violation be allowed by the public system that is morality

Only the requirement that the violation be publicly allowed, which requires that it be formulated in terms of the morally relevant features that all rational persons can understand, guarantees the kind of impartiality required by morality.

# Alternative Moral Theories
A Kantian system seems to rule out ever making lying promises, whereas the moral system allows the making of lying promises in some circumstances, e.g., when making the lying promise is necessary to prevent a harm sufficiently great that it is rational to estimate that less overall harm would be suffered even if everyone knew that such lying promises were allowed in these kinds of circumstances.

A consequentialist system favors breaking a morally acceptable law if it were extremely unlikely that one would get caught, no harm would result from that particular violation of the law, and you or your friend would benefit from the violation.
