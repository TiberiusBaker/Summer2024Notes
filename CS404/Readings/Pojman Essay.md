# Summary
Louis Pojman first analyzes the structure of ethical relativism as constituted by two theses: the #DiversityThesis and the #DependencyThesis.

He then examines #Subjectivism and #Conventionalism, arguing that both types have serious problems.

Indicates a way of taking relativist viewpoints while maintaining an objectivist position, outlining two objectivist arguments.

# Who's to Judge What's Right or Wrong?
#MoralRelativism - the dictates of morality arise from some sort of convention or understanding among people, that different people arrive at different understandings, and that there are no basic moral demands that apply to everyone

#EthicalRelativism - the doctrine that the moral rightness and wrongness of actions vary from society to society and that there are not absolute universal moral standards on all men at at all times.
- Accordingly, it holds that whether or not it is right for an individual to act in a certain way depends on or is relative to the society to which he belongs

## An Analysis of Relativism
We derive the following from the above statement about ethical relativism:
1. Moral rightness and wrongness of actions vary from society to society, so there are no universal moral standards held by all societies
	- Can be called the #DiversityThesis 
	- Simply a description that acknowledges the fact that moral rules differ from society to society.
	- Cultural relativism is well documented, and "custom is the king o'er all".
	- It would be very difficult to derive any single "true" morality by observing various societies' moral standards
2. Whether or not it is right for individuals to act in a certain way depends on (or is relative to) the society to which they belong
	- The #DependencyThesis 
	- asserts that individual acts are right or wrong depending on the nature of the society from which they emanate.
	- Morality does not occur in a vacuum, and what is considered morally right or wrong must be seen in a context that depends on the goals, wants, beliefs, history, and environment of the society in question.
	- There is no "innocent eye". We are simply culturally determined beings
	- The ethical relativist contends that even beyond environmental factors and differences in beliefs, a fundamental disagreement exists among societies.
		- One way for the relativist to support this thesis is to appeal to an indeterminacy of #IndeterminacyOfTranslationThesis, which maintains that there is a conceptual relativity among language groups so that we cannot even translate into our language the worldviews of a culture with a radically different language
3. Therefore, there are no absolute or objective moral standards that apply to all people everywhere
	- Follows from the first two propositions
	- Combining the #DiversityThesis with the #DependencyThesis yields #EthicalRelativism in its classic form. 

## Subjectivism
Some people think that the conclusion of relativism is still too tame, and they maintain that morality is not dependent on the society but rather on the individual

The author of this paper makes the claim that having this opinion makes it so that you cannot condemn others for their actions if their actions are part of their moral framework
# Conventionalism
#ConventionalEthicalRelativism - the view that there are no objective moral principles but that all valid moral principles are justified by virtue of their cultural acceptance, recognizes the social nature of morality.

The most famous of those holding this position is anthropologist Melville Herskovits, who argues that ethical relativism entails intercultural tolerance
1. If Morality is relative to its culture, then there is no independent basis for criticizing the morality of any other culture but one's own
2. If there is no independent way of criticizing any other culture, we ought to be tolerant of the moralities of other cultures
3. Morality is relative to its culture
4. Therefore, we ought to be tolerant of the moralities of other cultures

Author argues that this is not a good argument for tolerance.
- "If morality simply is relative to each culture, then if the culture in question does not have a principle of tolerance, its members have no obligation to be tolerant"

The author also states that under this view, reformers are always morally wrong and separate societies cannot condemn other societies for heinous morality.

# The Case for Moral Objectivism
On the Objectivist's account moral principles are what William Ross refers to as prima facie principles, valid rules of action that should generally be adhered to, but that may be overridden by another moral principle in cases of moral conflict.

If one can establish or show that it is reasonable to believe that there is at least one objective moral principle that is binding on all people everywhere, one shall have shown that relativism is probably false and that a limited objectivism is true.

The author chose the following principle to show this claim
- It is morally wrong to torture people for the fun of it

The author claims that this principle is binding on all rational agents, so that if some agent, S, rejects A, we should not let that affect our intuition that A is a true principle but rather try to explain S's behavior as perverse, ignorant, or irrational instead.
- In an example, the author says a possible reason that a tribe could be entirely against the principle above is if they are on a lower evolutionary level than most Homo sapiens (This feels like a somewhat racist claim to make)

The #CoreMorality, principles necessary for the good life
1. Do not kill innocents
2. Do not cause unnecessary pain or suffering
3. Do not cheat or steal
4. Keep your promises and honor your contracts
5. Do not deprive another person of his or her freedom
6. Do justice, treating equals equally and unequals unequally
7. Tell the truth
8. Help other people, at least when the cost to oneself is minimal
9. Reciprocate
10. Obey just laws

An objectivist who bases his or her moral system on a common human nature with common needs and desires might argue for objectivism somewhat in this manner:
1. Human nature is relatively similar in essential respects, having a commons et of needs and interests
2. Moral principles are functions of human needs and interests, instituted by reason in order to promote the most significant interests and needs of rational beings
3. Some moral principles will promote human interests and meet human needs better than others
4. Those principles that will meet essential needs and promote the most significant interests of humans in optimal ways can be said to be objectively valid moral principles
5. Therefore, since there is a common human nature, there is an objectively valid set of moral principles, applicable to all humanity
