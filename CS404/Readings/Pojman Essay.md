# Summary
Louis Pojman first analyzes the structure of ethical relativism as constituted by two theses: the #DiversityThesis and the #DependencyThesis.

He then examines #Subjectivism and #Conventionalism, arguing that both types have serious problems.

Indicates a way of taking relativist viewpoints while maintaining an objectivist position, outlining two objectivist arguments.

# Who's to Judge What's Right or Wrong?
#MoralRelativism - the dictates of morality arise from some sort of convention or understanding among people, that different people arrive at different understandings, and that there are no basic moral demands that apply to everyone

#EthicalRelativism - the doctrine that the moral rightness and wrongness of actions vary from society to society and that there are not absolute universal moral standards on all men at at all times.
- Accordingly, it holds that whether or not it is right for an individual to act in a certain way depends on or is relative to the society to which he belongs

## An Analysis of Relativism
We derive the following from the above statement about ethical relativism:
1. Moral rightness and wrongness of actions vary from society to society, so there are no universal moral standards held by all societies
	- Can be called the #DiversityThesis 
	- Simply a description that acknowledges the fact that moral rules differ from society to society.
	- Cultural relativism is well documented, and "custom is the king o'er all".
	- It would be very difficult to derive any single "true" morality by observing various societies' moral standards
2. Whether or not it is right for individuals to act in a certain way depends on (or is relative to) the society to which they belong
	- The #DependencyThesis 
	- asserts that individual acts are right or wrong depending on the nature of the society from which they emanate.
	- Morality does not occur in a vacuum, and what is considered morally right or wrong must be seen in a context that depends on the goals, wants, beliefs, history, and environment of the society in question.
	- There is no "innocent eye". We are simply culturally determined beings
	- The ethical relativist contends that even beyond environmental factors and differences in beliefs, a fundamental disagreement exists among societies.
		- One way for the relativist to support this thesis is to appeal to an indeterminacy of #IndeterminacyOfTranslationThesis, which maintains that there is a conceptual relativity among language groups so that we cannot even translate into our language the worldviews of a culture with a radically different language
3. Therefore, there are no absolute or objective moral standards that apply to all people everywhere
	- Follows from the first two propositions
	- Combining the #DiversityThesis with the #DependencyThesis yields #EthicalRelativism in its classic form. 

## Subjectivism
Some people think that the conclusion of relativism is still too tame, and they maintain that morality is not dependent on the society but rather on the individual

The author of this paper makes the claim that having this opinion makes it so that you cannot condemn others for their actions if their actions are part of the moral framework. This is absurd. You can. When laws are made around certain topics, a group of individuals is imposing their morality on a smaller group that may not necessarily agree with their moral outlook. Then society condemns the actions of the others because they have deemed in their moral framework that outing incorrect moral ideology is integral to maintaining their own morality and sense of decency.

I do not agree with the author in this section, who goes so far as to say, "On the basis of subjectivism Adolf HItler and serial murderer Ted Bundy could be considered as moral as Gandhi"

After some more research, i still mostly agree with what i said here in this section, however, I will put forward that I am something more of a Moral Descriptivist who believes that individuals morals come from their own idea of what they think will maximize their own pleasure. So an action is neither good nor evil intrinsically, it is good if it makes an individual feel pleasure or evil if not. 

# Conventionalism
#ConventionalEthicalRelativism - the view that there are no objective moral principles but that all valid moral principles are justified by virtue of their cultural acceptance, recognizes the social nature of morality.

The most famous of those holding this position is anthropologist Melville Herskovits, who argues that ethical relativism entails intercultural tolerance
1. If Morality is relative to its culture, then there is no independent basis for criticizing the morality of any other culture but one's own
2. If there is no independent way of criticizing any other culture, we ought to be tolerant of the moralities of other cultures
3. Morality is relative to its culture
4. Therefore, we ought to be tolerant of the moralities of other cultures

Author argues that this is not a good argument for tolerance.
- "If morality simply is relative to each culture, then if the culture in question does not have a principle of tolerance, its members have no obligation to be tolerant"
- I disagree with the author here, since Herskovits is not saying that tolerance must be a part of a culture, but instead that when one acknowledges that morality comes from cultural acceptance, one must then also be tolerant of other cultures, as one would see that the differences are due to cultural approval.

The author also states that under this view, reformers are always morally wrong and separate societies cannot condemn other societies for heinous morality.
