If all imperatives of duty can be derived from this one imperative as their principle, then there can be at least be shown what is understood by the concept of duty and what it means, even though there is left undecided whether what is called duty may not be an empty concept

The universality of law according to which effects are produced constitutes what is properly called nature in the most general sense.

We shall now enumerate some duties, following the usual division of them into duties to ourselves and to others and into perfect and imperfect duties
1. Maxim: from self-love I make as my principle to shorten my life when its continued duration threatens more evil than it promises satisfaction.
	1. Self love cannot possibly hold as a universal law of nature and is consequently, wholly opposed to the supreme principle of all duty
2. Maxim: when I believe myself to be in need of money, I will borrow money and promise to pay it back, although I know that I can never do so
	1. Cannot possibly hold as a universal law as it would make promising itself and the end to be attained thereby quite impossible if one were to believe himself to be in a difficult position, he could promise whatever he wants with no intention of paying it back
3. Maxim: when I have gifts that could be of great benefit, it is not necessary that such gifts be developed in sacrifice of comfort
	1. Cannot be implanted in us as such a law, as a rational being would will that all his faculties should be developed, inasmuch as they are given him for all sorts of possible purposes
4. Maxim: let everybody be as happy as Heaven wills or as he can make himself; I shall take nothing from him nor even envy him; but I have no desire to contribute anything to his well-being or to his assistance when in need
	1. If such a way of thinking were to become a universal law of nature, the human race admittedly could very well subsist and doubtless could subsist even better than when everyone prates about sympathy and benevolence and even on occasion exerts himself to practice them but, on the other hand, also cheats when he can, betrays the rights of man, or otherwise violates them

We must be able to will that a maxim of our action become a universal law; this is the canon for morally estimating any of our actions

If we now attend to ourselves in any transgression of a duty, we find that we actually do not will that our maxim should become a universal law--because it is impossible for us--but rather that the opposite of this maxim should remain a law universally

Since we at one moment regard our action from the standpoint of a will wholly in accord with reason and then at another moment regard the very same action from the standpoint of a will affected by inclination, there is really no contradiction
- Rather, there is an opposition of inclination to the precept of reason, whereby the universality of the principle is changed into a mere generality so that the practical principle of reason may meet the maxim halfway
- Although this procedure cannot be justified in our own impartial judgement, yet it does show that we actually acknowledge the validity of the categorical imperative and merely allow ourselves a few exceptions which, as they seem to us, are unimportant and forced upon us.

We have thus at least shown that if duty is a concept which is to have significance and real legislative authority for our actions, then such duty can be expressed only in categorical imperatives but not at all in hypothetical ones
- We have not yet advanced far enough to prove a priori that there actually is an imperative of this kind, that there is a practical law which of itself commands absolutely and without any incentives, and that following this law is duty

Duty has to be practical, unconditioned necessity of action; hence it must hold for all rational beings
- Any other derivation of a maxim can be valid for us, but not a universal law

Rational beings area called persons inasmuch as their nature already marks them out as ends in themselves, i.e., as something which is not to be used merely as a means and hence there is imposed thereby a limit on the arbitrary use of such beings, which are thus objects of respect

Everything empirical is not only quite unsuitable as a contribution to the principle of morality, but is even highly detrimental to the purity of morals

Is it a necessary law for all rational beings always to judge their actions according to such maxims as they can themselves will that such should serve as universal laws?
- If there is such a law, then it must already be connected with the concept of the will of a rational being in general
- He gets into metaphysics, its boring

Man, and in general every rational being, exists as an end in himself and not merely as a means to be arbitrarily used by this or that will.
- He must in all his actions always be regarded at the same time as the end

If there is to be a supreme practical principle and, as far as the human will is concerned, a categorical imperative, then it must be such that from the conception of what is necessarily an end for everyone because this end is an end in itself constitutes an objective principle of the will and can hence serve as a practical law.

Let us keep to our previous examples
1. If he destroys himself in order to escape from a difficult situation, then he is making use of his person merely as a means so as to maintain a tolerable condition till the end of his life
	1. Man however, is not a thing and hence is not something to be used merely as a means; he must in all his actions always be regarded as an end in himself
	2. Therefore, I cannot dispose of man in my own person by mutilating, damaging, or killing him
2. The man who intends to make a false promise will immediately see that he intends to make use of another man merely as a means to an end which the latter does not likewise hold
	1. For the man whom I want to use for my own purposed by such a promise cannot possibly concur with my way of acting toward him and hence cannot himself hold the end of this action.
3. With regard to contingent duty to oneself, it is not enough that the action does not conflict with humanity in our own person as an end in itself; the action must also harmonize with this end
	1. To neglect these capacities might perhaps be consistent with the maintenance of humanity as an end in itself, but would not be consistent with the advancement of this end
4. Concerning meritorious duty to others, the natural end that all men have is their own happiness
	1. Now humanity might subsist, but this after all, would harmonize only negatively and not positively with humanity as an end in itself, if everyone does not also strive, as much as he can, to further the ends of others
	2. For the ends of any subject who is an end in himself must as far as possible be my ends also, if that conception of an end in itself is to have its full effect in me
