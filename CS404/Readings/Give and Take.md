# The Altruism Debate
The defendant of pure altruism is C. Daniel Batson, who believes that we engage in truly selfless giving when we feel empathy for another person in need
- The greater the need, and the stronger our attachment to the person experiencing it, the more we empathize
- When we empathize with a person, we focus on helping him or her--not because it will make us feel good but because we genuinely care

The devil's advocate is Robert Cialdini, who argues there's no such thing as pure altruism.
- Believes that human beings are frequently generous, giving, and caring
- But he doesn't think these behaviors are entirely altruistic in origin
	- He believes that when others hurt, we hurt--and this motivates us to help
- Cialdini's first challenge to Batson's claims was that when empathy leads us to help, it's not because our ultimate goal is to benefit the other person
	- He proposed that when others are in need, we feel distressed, sad, or guilty

Batson's rebuttal: it's true that people sometimes help to reduce negative feelings, but this isn't the only reason and negative feelings don't always lead to helping
- When we feel distressed, sad, or guilty, our ultimate goal is to reduce these negative feelings
- If the goal is to reduce our own distress, we should choose whatever course of action makes us feel better
- If the goal is to reduce another person's distress, we should help even when it's costly and other courses of action would make us feel good

Cialdini wasn't done yet. He acknowledged that empathy can drive helping
- Feelings of concern and compassion certainly motivate us to act for the benefit of others at a personal cost
- Wasn't convinced that this reflects pure altruism
- He argued that when we empathize with a victim in need, we become so emotionally attached that we experience a sense of oneness with the victim.
	- This is why we help: we're really helping ourselves

Batson's team came back with another rebuttal: that _is_ altruism
- If we empathize with other people to the point of merging our own identities with theirs, we care about them as much as we care about ourselves.
- Because we no longer place our interests above theirs, helping them is purely altruistic.

The author chooses a middle point, saying: Most of the time that we give, it's based on a cocktail of mixed motives to benefit others and ourselves
