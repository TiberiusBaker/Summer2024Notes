GR Theorem: KNOW VERBATIM
- Treat others only as you consent to being treated in the same situation

GR forbids this combination
- I do something to another
- I'm unwilling that this be done to me in the same situation

# A GR Theorem
To apply the GR, we need to know what effect our actions have on the lives of others. And we need to imagine ourselves, vividly and accurately, in the other person's place on the receiving end of the action.

GR is a consistency principle, it doesn't replace regular moral norms

The author claims that their GR is a theorem--something provable from principles that are more basic

# The Literal Rule
People usually formulate the golden rule in simple ways, like "Treat others as you want to be treated"

Literal Golden Rule: If you want X to do something to you, then do the same thing to X.
- Can lead to absurdities in two types of cases.
	- Different situation
		- To a patient: if you want the doctor to remove your appendix, then remove the doctor's appendix
		- To a violent little boy who lives to fight: If you want your sister to fight with you, then fight with her
		- To a parent: If you want you child not to punish you, then don't punish him
	- Defective desires about how you are to be treated
		- To one who desires to be hated: If you want others to hate you, then hate them

GR's same-situation clause avoids the first kind of objection
- We can take the "same situation" here as "exactly similar situation" or "relevantly similar situation"
- To use GR correctly, say "I am willing that if"; don't say "I would be willing"

GR should not be taken itself as an infallible guide on right and wrong. Properly understood, GR doesn't tell us what specific action to take; instead it forbids inconsistent combination

To lead reliably to right action, GR needs to be combined with factual knowledge and imagination

Our GR formulation has three key features:
- A same-situation clause
- A present attitude toward a hypothetical situation, and
- a don't combine form

# Masochists
In dealing with masochist cases, we need a three-fold attack:
- We need to have the masochist imagine himself in the same situation as the other person
- We need some way to criticize irrational desires
- We need to recall that our GR forbids an inconsistent action-desire combination--and doesn't tell us what specific act to do

One can be consistent and follow GR, but still act wrongly. GR works best when combined with other factors, such as knowledge, imagination, and rationalized desires
