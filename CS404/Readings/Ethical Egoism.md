#PhycologicalEgoism tells us that our only motivation is self-interest.
- If this is true, then the only motivation we can have is to make ourselves better off
- This is not an ethical view, because it says nothing about what is right or wrong.
- If true, then there is little point in fashioning a morality that demands self-sacrifice
- If true, then all morality could possibly do is ask that we look out for ourselves

This is precisely the advice of #EthicalEgoism.
- Unlike #PhycologicalEgoism, it really is a moral theory
- It tells use about what we are morally required and forbidden to do
- Specifically, it says that there is one ultimate moral duty--to improve your own well-being as best you can

Ethical Egoism is the claim that one should do only the actions that benefit their self-interest

Many ethical egoists have been psychological egoists as well, but this is not required.

# Why Be Moral?
In the perfect world, virtue would always be rewarded and vice would never flourish

It is easy when morality and self-interest give the same advice. But what if they don't?
- If #EthicalEgoism is true, there are no such cases
- This sort of egoism claims that actions are morally right just because they best promote one's self-interest 

It may seem that there is nothing "ethical" at all about such a theory.
- Indeed it seems that we can use many examples to construct a decisive anti-egoist argument--call it the _Argument from Paradigm Cases_
1. If an ethical theory requires killing, rape, or theft, just because such actions promote self-interest, then that theory cannot be true
2. Ethical egoism sometimes requires such things, just because they sometimes do promote self-interest
3. Thus ethical egoism cannot be true

A paradigm is a model, a very clear example.

There are two replies that ethical egoists can offer to such an argument. They can reject the first, or the second premise.
- To reject the second, the egoist must argue that murder, rape, and theft can never make the perpetrators better off
	- The egoist may insist that getting what you want or being happy is not the ultimate key to well-being.
	- In this view, what is best for you is to live an upright life
	- This claim could be true if there is a God who punishes sin with eternal damnation. It could also be true if immoral acts deserve suffering, and a doctrine of karma ensures that, over the course of successive lives, you got what you deserved. 
	- But suppose that you don't find such accounts convincing, are there other ways to defend the idea that killing, theft, betrayal, and assault are never good for the perpetrators?
	- Plato tries, and spends a good part of the Republic arguing that all-powerful tyrants, though having much, are still doomed to terrible lives.
		- Once we see what an immoral life is really like, apart from the glamorous depictions of the publicists, we will realize that we are far better off being moral
		- This relies on Plato's assertions about the inner lives of immoral people
- Only those who already dislike egoism would accept the first premise. It is not a neutral claim
	- It assumes, specifically, that self-interest cannot morally justify actions that strike us as very bad

# Two Popular Arguments for Ethical Egoism
#EthicalEgoism clashes with our deepest moral beliefs. This happens in three ways.
1. Egoism may require some actions that seem grossly immoral.
2. Egoism forbids us from doing some actions that seem clearly morally good. Egoists think that any action that involves a genuine self-sacrifice is immoral.
3. Egoism permits us to escape some very important moral duties. It seems for instance, that we each have a duty of easy rescue. If saving someone comes at little or no cost to ourselves, then we must do what we can to help. Yet if your interests are best served by ignoring such victims, then egoism frees you of any duty to help.

## The Self-Reliance Argument
Often urged with approval

1. If everyone were to mind his own business, and tend only to his own needs, then everyone would be better off
2. We ought to do what will make everyone better off
3. Therefore, we each ought to mind our own business and tend only to our own needs

Two problems
- If first premise is false
	- Those who are in need of help would not be better off if others were to neglect them.
- second premise is one that egoists cannot accept

## The Libertarian Argument
Libertarians claim that our moral duties have only two sources: consent and reparation
- In other words, any duty we have to another person stems either from our voluntarily agreeing to accept that duty, or from our having violated someone's rights, and so owing a duty to repair the wrong we have done.

Little controversy that our duties can originate as the libertarian suggests. The real question is whether there are sources of duties other than consent and reparation.
- In the example of offering easy rescue, for instance, it seems that the victim's needs, together with my ability to help at little cost, are enough to generate a duty that I help.

The libertarian will deny that someone else's needs, plus one's own ability to help, are together enough to generate a moral duty of offering assistance.

Cannot support ethical egoism
- Egoists deny that there are two ultimate sources of moral duty. In fact, egoists deny that either of these is a source of moral duty

# The Best Argument for Ethical Egoism
Why be moral?
- Ethical egoism - morality serves self-interest

1. If you are morally required to do something, then you have good reason to do it
2. If there is good reason for you to do something, then doing it must advance your interests
3. Therefore, if you are morally required to do something, then doing it must advance your interests

Author argues that this argument is ultimately unpersuasive. He examines two superficially similar claims:
1. If an action advances your self-interest, then there is good reason for you to do it
2. If there is good reason for you to do an action, then doing it must advance your self-interest

The first claim looks good. 
- Difficulty to explain its plausibility however.
- It seems to be just one of those rock-bottom assumptions we make about the kinds of reasons we have.
- If someone were to deny it it isn't clear what we could say on its behalf.

Argument two is the same claim as the Best Argument's premise 2.
- many counter examples
- Cases of easy rescue provide the most compelling ones

# Three Problems for Ethical Egoism
1. It violates some of the deepest and most central moral beliefs we have
2. It cannot allow for the existence of moral rights
3. It arbitrarily assigns self-interest complete priority over the interests of others

## Egoism Violates Core Moral Beliefs
If a theory deeply violates common sense, then we are justified in rejecting it unless a compelling argument can be made on its behalf.

Egoism does run strongly counter to common sense, since it imposes a moral duty to kill, rape, torture or humiliate whenever doing so best serves self-interest.

## Egoism Cannot Allow for the Existence of Moral Rights
It isn't clear that egoism can make sense of moral rights.
- These are moral claims that give a person control over certain aspects of her life, even if it is to another person's advantage to ignore such moral claims

Suppose that it is in your best interest to kill me, or to deny me freedom of speech, or to take what I own.
- If egoism is true, then you are morally permitted--indeed, morally required--to do these things

Egoists can reply that they grant each person the right to pursue self interest. and that is true. but it is not the sort of right that offers any protection

## Egoism Arbitrarily Assigns Priority to Self-Interest
If ethical egoism is to be vindicated, its defends need to explain why we are allowed to entirely discount the interests of others, even though their fundamental interests may be identical to our own.

Suppose that my leg has been wounded in a hunting accident.
- I can still drive to the hospital and get it cared for
- I know that doing so is going to cost me almost all the money I have
- Once I arrive at the hospital, I see another victim of a hunting accident, with an injury very like my own
- He is obviously poor, needs the surgery as badly as I do, but lacks the money to pay for it.
- Most of us agree that it would be acceptable if I used my money to pay for my own surgery, rather than forgo it and pay for his
- but why?

Even if we accept that people are morally allowed to give themselves some priority, that does not mean that they are allowed to give themselves complete priority over others.
