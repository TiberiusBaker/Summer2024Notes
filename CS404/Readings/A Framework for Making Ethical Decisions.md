# Common-Sense Ethical Principles
Many ethical theories provide principles of conduct:
- Kant
- Utilitarian
- Golden Rule
- Ten Commandments

A good case can be made that there is a universally valid set of ethical principles that are reflected both in major ethical theories, such as the three just noted, and in at least many of the major religions of the world

To see what the common-sense moral principles are, we do well to begin with W. D. Ross's Famous list of "prima facie" obligations
1. _Justice_: The double-barreled obligation
	1. Negatively, not to commit injustice
	2. Positively, to prevent future injustices and rectify existing ones
2. _Non-injury_: the obligation to avoid harming others
3. _Fidelity_: The obligation to keep promises
4. _Veracity_: The obligation to avoid lying
5. _Reparation_: The obligation to make amends for wrong-doing
6. _Beneficence_: The obligation to do good deeds for others, especially to contribute to their virtue, knowledge, or pleasure
7. _Self-improvement_: the obligation to better oneself
8. _Gratitude_: the obligation to express appreciation for good deeds toward us

These obligations are prima facie in a special way: they have a moral force that, though overridable, is not completely eliminated even when it is overridden by conflicting obligations of higher priority
- For instance, in an econ slump, fidelity and beneficence to longstanding employees might result in financially harming some recently hired workers who must be laid off to avoid bankruptcy.
- Our final obligation here is one of combined fidelity and beneficence, and in this case it outweighs the obligation of non-injury owed to those recently hired

Final obligation, then, is determined relative to circumstances

The author proposes two other obligations:
9. _Liberty_: the obligation to preserve and enhance human freedom
10. _Respectfulness_: the category of obligations of manner

Characteristics of prima facie duties:
- Self-evident
- Non absolute
- Morally relevant
