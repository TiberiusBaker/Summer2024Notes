Everything we do has consequences. Consequentialist theories define what is morally right solely in terms of effects or consequences.

#Consequentialism - A general approach to ethics that maintains that only consequences determine what is morally right or wrong

# Utility and Consequentialism
Consequentialist theories often employ a concept of utility, describing desirable consequences as having utility and undesirable consequences as having disutility.
- Hedonists define utility as pleasure/happiness and disutility as pain
	- Still, we must distinguish between pleasure, a more short-lived feeling, and happiness, a state of mind related to personal fulfillment.
- Treating utility as mere pleasure creates some problems: 
	- there are morally bad pleasures, and other things appear as good as pleasure.
	- Thus it is tempting to try to define utility to include happiness rather than mere pleasure

#Utility - whatever makes consequences desirable; disutility, then, is undesirable.

## Utility and Mill's Account
For utility to encompass happiness while remaining measurable, Mill introduced different qualities of experience, proposing that greater moral weight belongs to higher-quality pleasures.

To determine which experiences are higher, we ask those familiar with both higher and lower-quality experiences.
- But there may not be any genuine moral difference between these

Other consequentialists have abandoned traditional hedonism and define utility in other ways.

#Qualities - allow us to distinguish between higher and lower pleasures; Mill thought the lower-quality pleasures deserve less moral weight

# Act Utilitarianism
Act utilitarianism defines specific accts as morally right or wrong; the right act in a situation is the one that will produce the greatest overall utility.
- to determine which this is, we consider our possible choices and the overall utility produced by each, taking into account each effect's scope, duration, intensity, and probability

When an effect includes both utility and disutility, the disutility is subtracted from the utility.
- We then compare the overall utility resulting from each choice
- The morally right choice is the one that will produce the most overall utility

#ActUtilitarianism - defines the morally right act, for a particular situation, as that which produces the greatest overall utility
#Scope - the individuals affected by an act; the greater the number affected, the greater the scope
#Duration - the time period over which an effect lasts
#Intensity - the degree of strength or force of an experience
#Probability - the chance or likelihood of an effect actually taking place

## Attractions and Problems
Several advantages
- Objective
- Simple
- Very flexible
- Easily extends to include animals that can be away of pleasure and pains

Several objections
- Requires that we do calculations to determine what is right, which can be difficult
	- Can be partly solved via rules of thumb, though this will sometimes lead us to make choices that are wrong according to act utilitarianism.
- Demands that we act as moral saints
- Encounters issues with promises, justice and rights. These are the most serious set of problems

#RulesOfThumb - Rules that tell us what we should do based on what usually promotes utility best in similar situations

# Beyond Classical Utilitarianism
Given the many serious objections to classical act utilitarianism, we might consider altering it.
- The most direct way to do this would be to redefine utility
- We also might try replacing the ideal goal of maximizing actual utility with the goal of maximizing expected utility

More significant changes would involve recharacterizing right acts to require a fairer distribution of utility than what we get by merely maximizing overall utility

#ExpectedUtilities - our best assessments of the utilities likely to result from each choices effects given our limitations and knowledge at the time
