# Utilitarianism: Maximize the Overall Good
#Utilitarianism - characterized as a consequentialist ethical theory, which directs us to "maximize the overall good" or to seek the "greatest good for the greatest number"
- When deciding how to act, it makes sense to look to the consequences of an action and decide accordingly
- Truth telling is a good example of Utilitarian thinking because it generally produces good consequences; for example, it engenders trust, it allows for accurate communication and understanding and it earns one a good reputation.
	- It is valued as a means to good ends

Utilitarians must provide an account of a good that would be convincing for all rational persons.
- They often cite pleasure and happiness 
- Then they stress the overall good as the appropriate goal of ethics

## Challenges to Utilitarianism
Utilitarians themselves disagree about what is intrinsically good, and they disagree about the appropriate means for attaining the maximum amount of that good

The good of utilitarianism must in some way be quantifiable.

The degree to which an individual is free to choose his or here own good. Pleasure and happiness are attractive ends for utilitarianism because they allow a wide range of personal freedom of choice.
- Yet the more utilitarians allow individuals the freedom to pursue their own understanding of the good, the closer utilitarianism comes to #EthicalRelativism, the view that values are relative to each individual
- Conversely, the more utilitarianism specifies the content of human goodness, the less likely it is that utilitarians will be able to defend the value of personal freedom

Utilitarians also disagree about the appropriate means for attaining maximum good
- No act, for them, is ever good in itself, at all times, and in all situations

The ends do not always justify the means, by to the utilitarian, they do.

The rights of individuals in Utilitarianism are not always protected
- For example, the individual right to bear arms could be seen as having a negative effect on society and removed in the name of Utilitarianism

# Ethics of Rights and Duties
Like #Utilitarianism, the second ethical tradition we consider starts with a common sense observation: the ends don't always justify the means.
- This approach holds that some acts are right and wrong in principle, regardless of consequences.

This approach is sometimes called #DeontologicalEthics, from the Greek words for the study (logos) of duty (deon).

What duties do we have?
- One type of example; when we examine situations in which individuals have role-specific duties, such as the duties of a lawyer, or ceo. 

A general ethical theory must offer an account of duties that are not dependent on roles and therefore could not be deserted by abandoning one's role.

The foremost account of such universal ethical duties appeals to the concept of individual right.
- On this approach, our basic ethical duty, the overriding duty that applies to all, is the duty to respect the rights of others

## Rights and Respect
In the 18th century, Immanuel Kant suggested that the problem with aggregating, consequentialist theories(like #Utilitarianism ) is that they treated persons merely as means and not ends in themselves.
- We cannot claim to respect individuals if we are willing to do anything to them for the sake of some desired social goal

The primary function of rights: to protect some areas of a person's life from utilitarian or majority rule deliberations, or merely from the harmful acts of other individuals
- In protecting interests from society or from other individuals, rights can be seen as entitlements or justified claims that impose duties on others.
- There is a standard thesis about rights known as the #CorrelatibityThesis
	- Maintains that all rights create duties for some other party or parties.
- In talking about rights, it is usually important to identify both what claim or entitlement a particular right justifies, and who is placed under a duty by that right

Legal Rights
- those granted by the principles and statues of a legal system, and they are often, but not always, enforced by the courts.

Ethical/Moral Rights
- derived from the principles of an ethical system and are often enforced through subtler sanctions, such as social expressions of disapproval that can range in seriousness up to treating the rights violator as a social outcast

Although philosophers disagree about many of the specifics of a rights-based approach to ethics, we believe that the interpretation of rights that follows best accounts for our deep commitment to rights and best explains how rights actually function in our shared moral experience.

## Dignity and Autonomy
What gives rise to the intuition that persons deserve respect?
- intuition is the basic tenet of ethics, a commitment that depends on nothing and is explained by nothing further.
	- Not satisfying
	- Usually we prefer to be able to explain our central beliefs, though esxplanation cannot go on forever
- The dignity of human beings is grounded in a peculiarly human attribute that philosophers have sometimes characterized as rationality, sometimes as free will, and sometimes as autonomy.
	- We define #Autonomy as the capacity to make reasoned deliberative choices about how to act.
	- What would it mean to respect that autonomy.
		- Certainly cannot mean allowing individuals the absolute ability to act in any way they choose.
		- Cannot mean allowing a person to have some merely formal choice available
			- Too weak an understanding

# What Type of Person Should One Be?
#VirtueEthics - approaches the fundamental ethical question of "How should I live?" less as a question about how to act and more as a question about the type of person to be.
- Not an alternative to utilitarianism and rights, as if one has to choose between them, but as a way to more fully account for the ethical life
- #Virtues are the character or personality traits that promote a meaningful and worthy human life
	- Sometimes described as habits, and a virtuous person is someone who has developed the right type of personal habits
- #Vices are those character traits that undermine the ability of person to live a good life

#VirtueEthics recognizes that human motivation is malleable, that people can learn and be taught what to want and that they can change their motivation
- Asks use to consider who we might avoid people becoming narrowly self-interested in the first place
- Recognizes that the environment in which an individual functions can have a profound influence on what that individual values, wants, and chooses.
- Encourages us to think carefully about human happiness
	- Virtue ethics suggests that with appropriate and modest desires, humans have a much better change of being happy than if they have the ever-increasing desires of consumer culture
