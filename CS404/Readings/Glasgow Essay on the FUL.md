# Kant's Principle of Universal Law
# Intro: The Good Will
The first commonsense intuition that Kant notes is that we don't usually change our evaluation of how good someone is merely because of how successful she is in pursuing her ends, as long as she is in fact sincerely pursuing them

# Two Kinds of Principles: Maxims and Imperatives
The claim about the good will above suggests a second basic intuition we have about ethics, namely that our moral evaluations focus on the agent's intentions, rather than her outward behavior
- The term that Kant uses to capture the intentional feature of one's will is "maxim".

A #Maxim, in brief, is an abstract description of the action one intends to perform
- When a maxim is explicitly formulated in Kant's technical sense, it will include three components
	- A description of the physical act you are performing
	- A description of the circumstances in which you are performing the act
	- The purpose or end of your action. An end is what the agent hopes to achieve in a given action, while the motive is why the agent hopes to achieve it.
		- I will do act A, in circumstance C, for end E.
- Every action has some maxim, whether or not the agent explicitly thinks about it.
- A maxim is a description of whatever action you intend to perform. It is not a principle about what you should do 

In contrast, there are normative principles, about what we ought to do, called #Imperatives

## Two Kinds of Imperatives: Hypothetical and Categorical
Here is where a third ordinary intuition about morality enters into Kant's ethical theory: moral claims are imperatives, rather than maxims
- When we use words like right and wrong, we are expressing the thought that people should or should not act in certain ways, and claims about what people should or should not do can be expressed as #Imperatives 

Kant claims that moral principles are rational principles.
- At the same time, ofc, we do not always do what is rational; we sometimes let our "inclinations" influence us independently of what reason tells us to do
- Kant makes this point to distinguish between imperfectly rational beings like us and perfectly rational or "holy" beings.

This explains why moral principles come in the form of imperatives for creatures like us.
- A rational principle details what it is rational to do, and as such it will simply describe the choices of a perfectly rational being.
- Since we are not perfectly rational, rational principles do not necessarily describe what we do. Rather, they details what we should o and accordingly can be expressed in imperative form

A #HypotheticalImperative expresses an ought-claim that applies to you by virtue of your subjective ends

A #CategoricalImperative expresses an ought-claim that applies to you independently of your subjective, personal ends.


# Moral Principles are Categorical Imperatives
Kant claims that moral principles must be #CategoricalImperative s.

If I have a moral duty to, say, keep my promise, I can't escape this obligation simply by changing my subjective ends so that this duty doesn't apply to me.

This then is the fourth ordinary moral intuition identified by Kant: moral imperatives obligate me independently of whatever subjective ends I might have

# The Categorical Imperative: Kant's Formula of Universal Law
Kant believes that there is only one Categorical Imperative
- Two caveats
	- There can be several derivative, or non-supreme principles of morality
	- Kant is also clear that while there is only one Categorical Imperative, it comes in several different formulations.
		- This has been long puzzled over how to make sense of this claim and how to understand the relations between the different formulations

The first formulation: The "Formula of Universal Law", or #FUL for short

Let us see now how Kant arrives at #FUL.

Categorical Imperatives can't use our subjective ends to tell us wht we need to do.
- According to Kant, what follows from this is that all we can say about the supreme principle of morality is that it must require our maxims to be compatible with its essential nature, and its essential nature has two parts
	- Kant thinks that morality's categorical nature has the force of law: unlike #HypotheticalImperative, which don't necessarily obligate us, moral imperatives bind us necessarily, like a law.
		- What is the character of law?
			- Universality
	- The Categorical Imperative is an imperative; that is, it prescribes to, or obligates, us.
- Thus we get the result that the Categorical Imperative must categorically obligate us to have maxims that can be universal laws.
- This is the basis of #FUL 

#FUL - Act only in accordance with that maxim through which you can at the same time will that it become a universal law.

Kant follows his presentation of #FUL by noting that our actions take place in the natural world.
So he gives us a second, related formulation of the Categorical Imperative, which Paton labeled the Formula of the Law of Nature (or #FLN):
- #FLN - Act as if the maxim of your action were to become by your will a universal law of nature

## FLN and Our Duties
When Kant says that we should act as if our maxims are going to become universal laws of nature, he is asking us to try to imagine a hypothetical world.
- That is, for any act you perform, you should try to imagine a world where your maxim is going to be a law of nature, which everyone had to conform to, just like everyone in the real world must conform to the law of gravity.

Kant's test: If the maxim can be a universal law of nature, then acting on it is morally permissible; if the maxim cannot be a universal law of nature, acting on it is morally forbidden.

Three steps to procedure for generating the moral duty of an act:
1. You must figure out your maxim. At its most precise, this will come in the ACE format.
2. You must universalize your maxim. To universalize your maxim is just to pretend that it is a universal law of nature, like the law of gravity--to try to think of a world where everyone does what you are doing.
3. Finally, you then see if this universalization is successful; Kant specifically means that you should see if you run into a contradiction

Kant thinks that when a duty is derived from a contradiction in conception, that duty is a #NarrowDuty.
- A #NarrowDuty is narrow in the sense that the agent has ne leeway in deciding when, how, and in what circumstances she will comply with it
- Not making false promises is a #NarrowDuty 

Kant also offers some #WideDuty s.
- A #WideDuty allows latitude in deciding when, how and in what circumstances the agent will fulfill them
- Beneficence is a #WideDuty 
- A #WideDuty  is derived from contradictions in the will
	- Arises when the maxim contradicts something else that the agent must will.
	- Kant has us imagine a person who could help others but decides not to
		- We can imagine a world in which nobody helped anybody else. This would not be a contradiction
		- However, if the person wanted the help, love or aid of someone else, it then becomes a contradicting question of: can one will the help of others in a world in which no one helps anyone else?
			- The answer is that we cannot, because those two willings are incompatible

# Two Potential Problems
Three potential objections to #FLN 
1. The problem of relevant descriptions is at least one factor in the other main problem, the problem of false positives/negatives: until we know how to properly describe our actions, we'll keep getting objectionable results, such that it's morally wrong to collect model trains or permissible to rob banks at gun point
2. Any action can have different maxims, which means that in principle one action can get different results on the universalizability test
3. If there are innumerable ways of describing my action, Kant's test seems woefully inadequate as a decision procedure, since i won't know which of my action's maxims to test.
